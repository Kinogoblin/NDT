explainer-3-title,Tutorial
explainer-3,"In the tutorial, you will learn everything about how to use the application itself, and how the application simulates real life events. You will be taught how to use the controls for your vehicle in order to accelerate, decelerate and steer your vehicle. You will also be taught how to control your camera to turn your head while in the vehicle in order to view the surroundings. You should pay close attention to the tutorial to understand the controls and how to use the application properly, but you can always repeat the tutorial if you want to."
explainer-4-title,Training
explainer-4,"There are multiple different training scenarios in the application. Each training module will go through a specific hazard situation and teach you how to deal with that specific situation. Training will vary between driving skills and safety skills, so make sure to visit the training section if you need to learn how to deal with any of the hazard situations that you encounter in the assessment mode."
explainer-5-title,Assessment
explainer-5,"In the assessment mode you will be tested at a very high level in multiple hazardous situations such as safety measurement, driving skills or generic situations such as interacting with the surrounding environment and reacting to other driver's mistakes. At the end of the assessment you will see your results based on how you performed during each scenario that showed up in the assessment mode. To pass the assessment, you must succeed at all of the tests you encounter in the assessment mode. If you fail the assessment you can always go to the training center, to learn how to deal with specific scenarios you failed in the assessment and try again."

highcog-tip-at-speed-limit,"Our vehicle has tipped over, even though we followed the advised speed limit on the sign! This is because these speed limits are for regular vehicles, but we are in a truck with a high center-of-gravity. We therefore need to reduce our speed to at least 10mph below the speed limit in order to avoid such a hazard. Press continue to reset your vehicle, and make sure to slow down to at least 10mph below the speed limit."
highcog-tip-at-speed-limit-2,"The speed of the truck can be further reduced depending on its type and load weight."
tm1-st3,"Our vehicle has tipped over! Even though we followed the advised speed limit on the sign. This is because these speed limits are for regular vehicles, but we are in a vehicle with a higher center of gravity which means we need to lower our speed 10mph-15mph lower than what the sign advises, in order to avoid a hazard like this one. Press continue to reset your vehicle and continue the module, and remember to hold down the brakes for longer to slow your speed down further."
tm1-st4,"Now we will begin the practice phase. We will practice doing these turns while following the correct procedures without any hints."
tm1-st4-question,"Use the gas and brake buttons to set an appropriate speed for this situation as shown on the speedometer, then press Continue."
